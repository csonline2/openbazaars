openbazaars-go banner OpenBazaars Server Daemon in Go
This repository contains the OpenBazaars server daemon which handles the heavy lifting for the OpenBazaars desktop application. The server combines several technologies: A modified IPFS node, which itself combines ideas from Git, BitTorrent, and Kademlia. A lightweight wallet for interacting with several cryptocurrency networks. And a JSON API which can be used by a user interface to control the node and browse the network. Find the user interface for the server at github.com/OpenBazaars/openbazaars-desktop.
